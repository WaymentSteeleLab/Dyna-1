`relaxdb_WITH_PHOS.txt` contains 133 proteins curated from our pipeline.

`relaxdb.txt` contains 111 proteins, removing those characterized in phosphate buffer and where exchange occurs that is unlikely to be attributable to us-ms motion.

NB: In the paper, we removed proteins with 0 or 1 positive labels from AUROC/AUPRC calculations. This corresponds to entries '5839', '6470', 'ORC2WH','PLEXINB1'.

`relaxdb-CPMG.txt` contains 10 proteins with to CPMG datasets.
